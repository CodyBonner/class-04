                    Streaming can often affect not only the one streaming by giving them a place to express themselves but it can also give back to the community by giving that community a place to feel like they belong, a place to feel welcomed and to express their own desires for acceptance. Sometimes streamers can also give back in a monetary way by getting involved with charities. All of these things can come from simply sharing your passion about something with others. In lamens terms, STREAMING IS GREAT!!
